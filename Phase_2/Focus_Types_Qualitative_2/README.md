# Focus Types Qualitative Analysis 2

## Takeaway
Students concentrate their troubleshooting attention in three main areas: component analysis (43%), outcome verification (31%), and circuit-level understanding (15%). Component-focused troubleshooters examine individual parts and connections, while outcome-focused students emphasize measuring circuit outputs. Process-focused approaches, representing 11% of sessions, involve systematic methodology discussion.

## What's Important About This Figure
This qualitative analysis reveals diverse troubleshooting focus strategies:
- **Component Focus** (43%): Detail-oriented approach examining individual parts
- **Outcome Focus** (31%): Results-oriented approach emphasizing measurements
- **Circuit Understanding** (15%): System-level approach considering overall design
- **Process Focus** (11%): Methodology-oriented approach discussing systematic steps

These focus types may represent different learning styles or expertise levels in troubleshooting.
