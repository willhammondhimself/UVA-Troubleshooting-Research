# Student Distribution vs Expert Analysis

## Takeaway
Most students observed more troubleshooting actions than actually occurred in the video. While Professor Caroline identified 5 actions when reviewing her own troubleshooting session, 58% of students reported seeing more actions than this baseline. The most common student response was 7 actions, suggesting systematic over-interpretation of troubleshooting behavior.

## What's Important About This Figure
This figure is crucial for understanding observation accuracy in engineering education. It reveals:
- A systematic bias toward over-observation in novice engineers
- The gap between expert and novice perception of troubleshooting activities
- Potential implications for how students learn from demonstrations and peer observation
- The need for training in accurate observation skills
