# Comprehensive Difference Index Analysis

## Takeaway
Students show systematic differences from Professor Caroline's expert observation patterns across multiple dimensions. The comprehensive difference index reveals that most students (64%) demonstrate moderate differences from the expert baseline, while only 10% achieve expert-like or good observation accuracy. This multi-dimensional analysis captures content accuracy, temporal alignment, quantitative precision, and behavioral consistency.

## What's Important About This Figure
This comprehensive metric provides a holistic view of observation accuracy by combining multiple dimensions:
- Content accuracy (what actions/strategies were observed)
- Temporal alignment (when behaviors were observed)
- Quantitative precision (how many behaviors were counted)
- Behavioral consistency (pattern matching with expert)

The index reveals that observation skills are multifaceted and most students struggle across several dimensions simultaneously.
